PipePanic
=========

A puzzle game with algorithmic-solving capabilities made in Java using Eclipse IDE. Players attempt to shut off the water flowing out the pipes. By clicking a pipe, it toggles the water on/off as well as the on/off state of the neighbouring pipes. A single player can play through 20 created levels, with different introduced mechanics such as conveyors, and wrenches.

Players play the game using the mouse. The mouse navigates through the menus, changes the state of the currently selected pipe and can be dragged to move the conveyors.

Pipe Panic was a Grade 12 pair project between Tom Huang and myself. For levels without extra mechanics, there is an algorithm created to solve the puzzle in the least moves and interactively reproduce the solution step by step to the user. Tom and I created the algorithm using induction and recursion, based off recurrent patterns while testing different cases. Tom worked on the interaction between pipes, the underlying board array and the user inputs. I designed the graphics in Adobe Illustrator, integrated it within the game, programmed in additional game pieces/mechanics and implemented the algorithm into solving the puzzles.
